# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
The website showcases my background, projects, and ways to get in touch.

## 📌 About the Website
The portfolio is designed to be clean, minimal, and easy to navigate.  
Each section is placed on a **separate page** rather than a single scrolling layout.

Pages included:
- **Home** – Introduction and overview  
- **About** – Background, skills, and interests  
- **Projects** – Selected projects with descriptions  
- **Contact** – Ways to get in touch
- **Not Found** - Landing page added in to better understand routing (mainly for fun)
